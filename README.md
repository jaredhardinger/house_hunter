### About

* This application models a real estate database with Real Estate Agents as 'parents' and the houses they represent as 'children' 

### Built With

* ruby 2.7.2, Rails 5.2.8, rspec 4.01

### Getting Started

* Fork and clone the repository. Ensure ruby and rails are the same version, bundle install the gems, and then from the application's root run a `rails server` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in a web browser. See the schema design at [this link](https://app.dbdesigner.net/designer/schema/539869)

### Testing

* Tests are run using RSpec with the rspec-rails, capybara, simplecov, and shoulda-matchers gems installed. SimpleCov calculates 100% coverage.

### Challenges & Wins

* The most difficult component was using query params and sorting out how, where, and why to access them. Combining the query params with a submitted form further boggled the mind. In the end, I got it to work, though!
